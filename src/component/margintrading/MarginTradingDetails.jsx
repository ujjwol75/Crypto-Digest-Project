                <h2 className='tradingQueryeHead'>What is Bitcoin Margin Trading?</h2>

                <p>Bitcoin margin trading, in simple words, allows opening a trading position
                    with leverage, by borrowing funds from the exchange.</p>

                <p>For example, if we opened a Bitcoin margin position with a 2X leverage and Bitcoin
                    had increased by 10%, then our position would have yielded 20% because of the 2X leverage.
                    With no leverage, it would have been only a 10% ROI.</p>

                <p>Margin leverage can also be 25X and even higher, despite the risk, the same position as
                    described above would have yielded 250%
                    (instead of 10% with no leverage).</p>

                <h2 className='tradingQueryeHead'>How does Bitcoin margin trading work?</h2>

                <p>In most cases, the exchange provides loans to the traders so they can enlarge
                    their capital to be used for margin trading. This way, traders can open positions
                    with high leverage. The exchange doesn’t have many risks since every
                    position has its liquidation price, which is based on the level of leverage.</p>

                <h2 className='tradingQueryeHead'>How to Short Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies?</h2>

                <p>Want to make gains while Bitcoin price is decreasing? It’s possible. A short
                    position on Bitcoin basically means that we believe in a coming-up drop in
                    the price of Bitcoin. Technically, short positions work by selling the base asset first,
                    in this case, Bitcoin, and then later buying it. You don’t
                    have to worry; the exchanges do this process automatically for us.</p>

                <p> The second role for shorting Bitcoin is the option to hedge a cryptocurrency portfolio.
                    For example, if the crypto portfolio consists of 5 Bitcoin and we want to hedge against
                    the risk of a possible Bitcoin’s decline, a 10X leveraged short position could
                    be opened, and it would be equivalent to 40% of that Bitcoin portfolio.</p>

                <p>To open the position, the amount required is only a tenth of it (10 times leverage).
                    That means that we need to hold only 0.2 Bitcoin on the margin exchange in order to hedge
                    40% of a portfolio valued 5 Bitcoins. Another advantage is the fact that only a small
                    amount is stored on the exchange itself. As you might notice,from security reasons,
                    it’s better to store the least amount possible on crypto exchanges.</p>

                It is now possible to trade margin on most exchanges. The advantages of leveraged trading 
                are very clear, and another significant benefit comes from the security aspect. Crypto
                 traders should strive to minimize the number of coins they hold on exchanges. Exchanges 
                 are considered hot targets for hackers, and in recent years there have been several
                 hackings of exchanges, including hacks of the major exchanges too.
